This post is an analysis of Analysis of *More than 6,000 antibiotic resistance genes discovered in the bacteria that inhabit the human gut* [@UniversityofBirmingham]. 


## Summary 

Bacterium adaptation to the surrounding environment is an undeniable and growing phenomenon. Nevertheless, some of these adaptations concern researchers because they pose a real threat to human health and are the origin of an increasing number of deaths each year.

Are all these bacteria originally dangerous? It’s a halftone answer. On the one hand, some bacteria have caused deadly infectious diseases for centuries such as staph but their rising dangerousness over the years is only the result of human errors. Where bacteria adapt to human innovations in order to survive, human has increasingly difficulties to counter the adaptive response of bacteria. The phenomenon is extremely important in the case of drug-resistant bacteria called “superbugs”. By prescribing antibiotics in an abusive way, bacteria have gradually succeeded, by their defense mechanisms such as the horizontal genes transfer or the transformation of their body wall, in dodging them to such an extent that some antibiotics, such as the Vancomycin, are totally useless against some bacteria.

| Published in? 	| November 30, 2018 	|
| General topic? 	| A team of European researchers has developed an innovativemethod to identify antibiotic resistance genes produced by the bacteria	|
| Procedure/what was examined? 	| The method consists of comparing the proteins produced by the bacteriafound in the human intestine, tostructures of antibiotic resistance enzymes already identified.Then, researchers have applied this innovative technique tomillions of genes located in the gut. 	|
| Conclusions/discovery? 	| Thanks to this approach, no more than 6000 new antibiotic resistance genes have been discovered. Nevertheless, thehuman gut is also a place of living for several pathogenicbacteria which are increasingly resistant to antibiotics.|
| Remaining questions? 	| Could these resistance genes be transferred to pathogenic bacteria by using antibiotics? Could this phenomenon reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics in the future? 	|
