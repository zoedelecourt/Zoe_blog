## Analysis table

- Researchers? 
    + Harvard Medical School : Thomas Kupper
- Published in? when (if mentioned)?
    + Npj vaccines (04/01/2021)  
- General topic
    + Scratching the skin with a needle to inject a vaccine could help create T-cell involved in the lung's immune reaction
- Procedure/what was examined
    + They inoculated the smallpox vaccine to mice using different methods: skin scarification, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal injection
    
- Conclusions/ discovery
    + Mice which had the vaccine using skin scarification produced more T-cells in general but most importantly more lung-specific T-cell.Therefore they were resistant to lethal viral doses 

- Remaining questions ? 
    + Will this phenomenon also happened in the human body ?
